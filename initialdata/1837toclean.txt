To the Honorable Senate, and Honorable House of Representatives: In obedience to the provisions of the Act of the 19th of April last, I have the honor to submit an Abstract of the Returns of the Asses- sors of all the Towns and Cities in the Commonwealth, concerning certain branches of industry. I have, in' the first instance,-presented a sketch of the return re- ceived from each city and town; then an Abstract, by counties, of the ansroers to the questions proposed in the Act; next an Abstract, by counties, of the statements of the Assessors in addition to their an- swers; and finally, a condensed Summary of the whole. The Assessors of many of the towns have confined themselves, or nearly so, to rendering answers to the questions proposed; while others have taken pains, in addition to their answers, to gather and present the statistics of other branches of industry, some of which are well known to be carried on in towns whose returns do not allude to them. Had the Assessors, in all cases, been equally particular in their inqui- ries and returns, it is believed that the aggregates would have been considerably greater than those exhibited in these tables. The raw materials used in many of the' specified manufactures, are the produce of other parts of the world. The value of these,I have, of course, no means of determining with accuracy. Sufficient,á how- ever, on these points, is known, to render it probable that the addi- tional value given to those raw materials, by the creative industry of our fellow-citizens, is at least equal in amount to the entire crops of any of those States, whose staple articles constitute the mo!ilt promi- nent objects of our national export. á ' These tables, (with the exception of that portion which concerns sheep and the fisheries,) embrace none of the statiatics of our airicul- LETTER. ture or commerce, and of course fall very far short of presenting a complete view of the products of the State ; they are, however, suffi- ciently ample, to illustrate the triumphant success of judicious and persevering enterprize, and indicate that the prosperity of Massachu- setts, notwithstanding natural disadvantages of soil and climate, has an unfailing source in the intelligent industry of her people. Very respectfully,Your obedient servant, JOHN P. BIGELOW, Secretary of tht CommonwealtTt.. AN ACT To obtain Statistical Information in relation to certain branches of Industry within the Commouwealth. BE it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives, in General Court assembled, and by the autl1ority o f the same, as follows: SEc.
