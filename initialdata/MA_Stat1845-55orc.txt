ADVERTISEME NT.




  THE territory of Massachusetts, consisting of about 7500 square miles, is divided into 809 towns.   The General Court of  the year 1845 passed an Act (Chapter 171) "to obtain statistical information in relation to certain branches of industry." The Act provided that the assessors of each town should, between the first day of May and the first day of October, 1845, make a return into the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, of facts falling under certain specified descriptions, as they should be found to have existed in each town on the fil'llt day of April of the same year. The Secretary was directed to prepare blank tables, conveniently arranged for the return of those facts, with blank columns for returns of similar particulars not enumerated, and to fur­ nish three copies, with a copy of the law, to the assessors  of each town, on or before the first day of May.   The  assessors  were allowed a stipulated sum for each day's service in making and reporting their investigations, to be paid from the treasury of the Commonwealth, and were subjected to a fine for neglect. The Secretary was instructed to prepare and print an abstract from the returns for the use of the Legia· lature.   The result of this action appears in the following pages.
  It is probable that the statements are far from presenting a complete view of the  industry of the  Commonwealth, in  either  of the  depart-
• ments to which they relate. All the towns made returns, and the aaseason are sworn officers.  But  in  some  instances, (as in the towns of Ware and Stoughton, in which are one woollen and six cotton mills,) their applications for information were denied, and as, in all instances, the answers of interested parties were voluntary, the disposition to understate the value of property subject to taxation  must be supposed to have operated to some extent. The applications of industry in Massachusetts are also extremely diversified ; and though the Act re­ quired returns of products not expressly referred to therein, it is to be presumed that not a few of these escaped observation. The returns of agricultural products, in particular, are believed to fall far below the truth.

iv	ADV.ERTISEMENT.

  The general plan of the following compilation is the same as that adopted by !\fr. Secretary Bigelow, for  the  same  purpose, in  1837 The collection of facts, and the amount of prod ucts exhibited, is much larger, as was to be· expected from the growth of the population and the increased activity in the manufacturing and  mechanical  arts, as well as from the more thorough investigation required by the recent law, the more just appreciation of the object prevailing at the present time among our citizens, and the experience acquired by many of the assessors in conducting the former inquiries.
  In the following transcript of the town Returns, a few abbreviations of words of constant recurrence have been adopted, which it is be­ lieved will immediately become familiar to the reader, and will facili­ tate comparison, as well as prevent the volume from swelling to an unwieldy size.   An explanation of them is given on page 1.
lu some  instances, the n umber or quantity of articles manufactured
' \	.	.
or prod uced was retu rned  by the  assessors, without a statement of the
value. In such cases, in making up the tables, (see page 329 and fol. lowing), an estimate of the val ue has been made from the other re­ turns. The same course has been pursued in cases where the value of articles manufactured or produced has been returned, without a state­ ment of the  number or quantity.   In many instances,  there  has been a fail ure of retu rns, both of the amount of capital invested and the number of hands employed. No estimate has been made to supply such deficiencies, except in a few cases of hands employed. The aggregates under those two heads therefore are doubtless  very much less than would have been furnished by more complete returns.
  Of the "val ue of all other articles" (see pages 362 and  378) be· sides those specified in the tables, the amount of $2,6641693 is included in the return from Boston, being that of articles of which returns are not made from any other pince, with perhaps one or two trifling ex­ ceptions. The  particulars which make up this amount will  accord­ ingly be found on pages 4-7, beginning  with  "artificial  flowers" and  ending  with  "wire  work."     The  balance  o( the  amount,  viz.
$2,093,691, icludes the value of every manufactured article in the returns, not entered in any other table ; some of which were specified in the returns, and some merely put down in gross, in reply to the inquiry in the ct for the " gross  value of all other articles manufac­ tured in the town during said year."
  Pins, screws, silk and linen  cloth, hem p, bras!l hinges, and starch from potatoes, are articles specified_ by the Act, but there is no return

of either. Under "cards" the Act  makes  no  distinction  between playing, visiting, wool, and any other kind of cards, and the returns have the same indefiniteness.
  In the arrangement of the several articles in the tables beginning on page 329, they succeed each other in the same order in which they are named in the Act.  The following articles, not inquired for by the Act, have a place assigned them in the tables, on account of their import· ance ; viz. casks, fringe and tassels, boxes, earthen and stone ware, , sashes, doors, blinds and frames, lasts, lard oil and dyeing, at the end of the  products of manufacture (pp. 359-362) ; shingles (p. 362), bark and  charcoal  (p. 363), buck-wheat  (p.  369),  beef  slaughtered  for market (p. 368), fish, besides cod and mackerel (p. 366), and oil be­ sides whale oil (p. 365), in connection with similar articles ; and milk, maple sugar, poultry and eggs, garden seeds, berries, and broom seed and brush (p. 372), at the end of the list.
  In the arrangement of the Summary, beginning on page 373, it seemed at first view desirable to separate the products of manufacture from the agricultural, animal, and other products. But so many arti­ cles, as butter, cheese, fire ·wood, maple sugar, &c., are of a mixed character in this respect, as to prevent such a discrimination  from being satisfactorily carried out. The whole are therefore set down together in alphabetical order.
  The return required by the Act of the number and value of horses, neat cattle, sheep, swine, asses, and mules, in the Commonwealth, in April last, makes these returns unsuitable to be introd uced into a sum· mary which in all the other particulars exhibits the products of a single year.    They are accordingly arranged in a separate table (p. 377).
  The Act requires  returns  of the  quantity of oil, coal, and all other
articles, (except cotton, wool, and iron,) consumed in manufacturing. These are presented in the table on page 364, but of course are not introd uced into the Summary. The Act did not contemplate a collec­ tion, to any extent, of facts relating to the  amount  of raw  material used ; but a few particulars, in relation to cotton, wool, iron, hides, and some others, will be found under the heads of the related ·branches of mechanical industry.
  In the hope of making some further approach  to the  completeness of th view, designed by the Act, of the industrial activity and re­ sources of Massachusetts, I have obtained from the Treasury Depart· ment at Washington a statement of facts relating to the commerce of the Commonwealth, from July  1st, 1844, to July  1st, 1845.   It is given
