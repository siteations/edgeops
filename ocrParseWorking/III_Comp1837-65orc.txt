Woollen Mills. Under this head the Assessors return the following Report from the Agent of the Salisbury Manufac.turing Company:.
" The Works of the Salisbury Manufacturing Company are located both in Salisbury and Amesbury, (the dividing line of the towns being only a small river,) and so arranged that the machinery in both towns is connected in the operation. 
There ar& in both towns 6 mills, w.i.th 50 sets of machinery, 1 Printing Mill, together with Dye Houses, Dry Houses, Ma.chine Shops, Sorting House, and other buildings.

Owing to the long continued droQght, the stream upon which the S. M. Co's. works are situated gave out, and the Company were obliged to suspend operations for something over three months last year, by which means the product was materially 
¥ 	smaller than it would otherwise have been. The Company have, therefore, only given their business for the six months end.ing June ist, 1855. This should be divided about equally between the two towns."
